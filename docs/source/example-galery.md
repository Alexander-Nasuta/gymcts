# Example Gallery

The example gallery contains a collection of examples that demonstrate how to use the library with different environments.
It features the well-known OpenAI Gym environments, such as CartPole and FrozenLake.
However MCTS excels especially well in environments that have a fixed number of steps, and will terminate even when taking random actions.
This is the case for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP), which is also included extensively in the example gallery.
