# Frozenlake Gallery

This section contains a collection of examples that demonstrate how to use the library with the FrozenLake environment.
The FrozenLake environment is a classic reinforcement learning environment that is often used to test and benchmark reinforcement learning algorithms.
It may not be the best fit for a MCTS approach, but a lot of researches are familiar with it and it is a good starting point for getting to know the library.

.. note::

    Please note that you have to install the gymnasium library in order to run the examples.
    You can do this by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: shell
        
        pip install gymnasium

```
